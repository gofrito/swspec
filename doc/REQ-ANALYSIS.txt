v1.00 Requirements Analysis
-----------------------------------

  - preferences: computation on Cell, data on Intel, better than 2 bit
  
  - integrating real-to-complex FFT with windowing function and overlap 
       - overlap: how much? fixed at 25%? adjustable?

  - two polarizations as independent data sets (hmm why not merge 2xReal to complex...)
   
  - initial goal is 16 MHz analog bandwidth per channel, 8-bit samples
    => 32 Ms/s or 256 Mbit/s   

  - can use 2-bit test data initially when readily vailable DAS's can't do 
    any better (currently looks like it... can do tests with Matlab-generated 8-bit dummy data of course..)

  - the data source and the data format is not 100% clear... 
       - initially just use files from NFS
       - VSIB support desired for Kronian data working ASAP
       - add true cluster or fake cluster UDP network connectivity
       - JIVE has some VSIB's so this would be one good Metsähovi-supported way getting VSI/ADC data into Intel
       - JIVE Mark5's w/ StreamStor could use 'in2file' style of code to get data from VSI/ADC/Mk4fmt

  - data output format is ASCII, contains power spectrum, just a column of numbers in e.g. full precision ~17 digit

  - first make stand-alone program with file inputs

  - later assume FieldSystem somehow calls 'swspectrometer' when antenna data is valid 
    or available somewhere

  - FieldSystem controls the observation, several phases
       - when on-target  accumulate spectrum into file ON_xxxx
       - when off-target accumulate spectrum into file OFF_xxxx
       - when cal-target accumulate spectrum into file CAL_xxxx
       - xxxx is sequential number of nodding cycle (counter...)

  - initially a astro spectrometer implementation only, but later S/X S/C kept in mind for v1.01

  - keep in mind 4 channels for S/X S/C tracking

  - astro spectrometer needs no more than 4-8K FFT channels, for S/C 64-128K FFT channels more suitable

      - one Cell SPE can't fit 64K*8byte=512KB of data !!
        -- TODO check IBM SDK 3.0 for new FFT funcs, 
           or use my FFTW Cell patch
              http://www.metsahovi.fi/~jwagner/Cell/fftw-patch/ps3-001.kurp.hut.fi.1d.scxx.p2.gif
           and expect 8-12 GFLOPs (check if FFTW has been finally updated to allow the
           user to limit the number of SPEs the FFTW reserves for itself... otherwise can't use FFTW...)
          
  - astro spectrometer expected 80s integration time with single pass over the data


v1.01 Requirement Analysis
-----------------------------------

  - S/X S/C implementation
 
  - Hilbert transform - how accurate do you want it?
    Several FFT passes, per Sergei ~10 FFTs for 50-60 dB accuracy
     - "50 dB accurate Hilbert transform can be made as a set of properly windowed and overlapped FFT&IFFTs"
     - "with more aggressive push goes to 180 dB, double"
     - need to invent some smarter than before way to do an Hilbert xform :-)
  - PCA or SVD instead of Hilbert was one idea, better on efficient 'double' accuracy platforms

  - S/C tracking expected 1000s integration time with multiple passes over the data 
     - desired 1 uHz resolution in a ~100 Hz band window around one or more detected carriers that have been PLL-locked
     - Sergei says 10 minutes of data would have to be buffered
     - home many passes? could just run them in parallel on many PS3s or time interleaved on one PS3?
